A security tool with advanced features for security analysis, password management, encryption, and hash generation. 

(It’s not suitable for cryptocurrency; I will make another project for that, so don't use this hash with bitcoin.)

##  Features Overview

### 1.  Password Strength Analysis
- Length verification
- Character diversity analysis
- 0-5 scoring system with improvement suggestions
- Pattern detection for common weak passwords

### 2. Password Generation
**Quick Generate:**
- All character types enabled
- (12-32 range)
- Instant strength feedback

**Custom Generate:**
- Select character types: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special
- Guaranteed inclusion of selected types
- Secure random shuffling

### 3. Memorable Passwords
- Word combinations (2-8 words)
- Hyphen-separated format
- Random number suffixes
- JUST 27+ word dictionary

### 4. Hash Generation
- **MD5** - Fast (32-character hex)
- **SHA-256** - Secure (64-character hex) 
- **SHA-512** - Maximum security (128-character hex)

### 5. AES Encryption/Decryption
- Symmetric encryption with 256-bit keys
- Password-based key derivation (SHA-256)
- Base64 encoded output
- Integrity verification

### 6. Hash Comparison
- Data integrity verification
- Tampering detection
- MD5 and SHA-256 support
- Clear match/mismatch results

## Security Notes

### Best Practices
- Uses `SecureRandom` for cryptographic randomness
- SHA-256 key derivation for AES
- Comprehensive input validation
- Multi-factor password analysis

### Limitations
- **MD5**: Cryptographically BROKEN - use for checksums only
- **Educational purpose**: For learning and testing
- Always use 12+ character passwords
- Never reuse passwords across services
- I’m still studying cryptography and working on this project.

##  Future Enhancements

- BCrypt/Argon2 support
- Password breach checking
- Graphical interface
- File hashing capabilities
- Multi-factor authentication
